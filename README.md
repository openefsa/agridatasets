# Open datasets for crop modeling describing climate and soil in France.

This repository contains open datasets for climatic data (1975-2014, 25x25 km grid cells) and soil characterization (1x1 km grid cells) allowing easier parameterization for crop simulation models.

## Gridded Agro-Meteorological Data in Europe
> [Agri4Cast](http://agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/DataPortal/SignIn.aspx?idResource=7&o=d) CGMS database contains meteorological parameters from weather stations interpolated on a 25x25 km grid. Meteorological data are available on a daily basis from 1975 to the last calendar year completed, covering the EU Member States, neighbouring European countries, and the Mediterranean countries.

## European Soil Database
> [ESDB](http://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/esdb-derived-data) A number of layers for soil properties have been created based on data from the European Soil Database in combination with data from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and Soil-Terrain Database (SOTER). The available layers include: Total available water content, Depth available to roots, Clay content, Silt content, Sand content, Organic carbon, Bulk Density, Coarse fragments. [@Hiederer2013]
